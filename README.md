## HELLO THERE!ðŸ‘‹

I am Shipra Lade. A girl who wants to learn Coding and trying her best to learn coding in fire in a house situation trying to reduce the flood of Assignments and work which I can't discuss due to the contract and might lose my marks if i addressed it here or anywhere...so yah I am an intern somewhere so I am trying my best to learn Programming/coding on my own as learning in rush and jumping to advance is Frying my brain and burning me out like crazy.

I am looking forward to learn programming and try my best to be good in atleast game development as i am interested in games and coonsoles dreaming to associated with gaming since 12.
Also I am more of a electronics person who is actually being an all rounder in 3 fields: Electronics,Computer and AI.
